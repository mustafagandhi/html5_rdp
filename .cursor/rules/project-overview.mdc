# üñ•Ô∏è Real Remote Desktop Platform - Project Overview

## üìò Project Description

This project is a self-hosted, browser-based Remote Desktop solution designed to connect securely to full session-based desktop environments (Windows) without relying on Microsoft‚Äôs RDP protocol. It uses open or custom protocols and provides an experience similar to Google Remote Desktop or AnyDesk, but fully customizable, scalable, and enterprise-ready.

## ‚úÖ Core Objectives

### 1. Web-Based Desktop Access

* Full desktop rendered inside modern web browsers
* No proprietary plugins or extensions required
* Responsive UI for desktop and mobile
* GPU-accelerated `<canvas>` rendering of remote sessions

### 2. Native Host Agent

* Cross-platform agent (Windows) for frame capture, input injection, and transport
* Built in Rust or Go for performance and safety
* Operates as a service with optional tray UI
* Supports hardware-accelerated capture and encoding (e.g., H.264)

### 3. Secure Real-Time Transport

* WebRTC (UDP/DTLS-SRTP) and WebSocket (TLS) fallback
* Separate media and control channels
* Zero-trust token-based authentication

### 4. Remote Control Features

* Mouse, keyboard, and touch input handling
* Bidirectional clipboard sharing
* Drag-and-drop file upload
* Audio streaming and printer/device forwarding

### 5. Security and Access Control

* Encrypted communication (TLS 1.3, AES-GCM, WebCrypto)
* Token or QR-based device pairing
* Session isolation and timeout
* Audit logging and compliance support

### 6. Enterprise-Ready UX

* Modern UI/UX with dark/light themes
* Real-time session diagnostics and telemetry
* Role-based access control (RBAC)
* Responsive layout and keyboard shortcuts
* Internationalization-ready

## üß± Technical Stack

### Frontend (Web Client)

* JavaScript (ES6+), optionally TypeScript
* HTML5 `<canvas>` and WebGL for rendering
* CSS Modules / CSS-in-JS for styling
* WebRTC (Pion/WebRTC native bindings)
* WebSocket fallback with reconnection logic

### Backend (Native Agent)

* Rust or Go
* Screen capture APIs: DXGI (Windows)
* Input injection: `SendInput`, `uinput`, `libinput`
* Encoding: FFmpeg, GStreamer, WebCodec API
* Transport: WebRTC, QUIC, TLS

### DevOps & Packaging

* Installer: NSIS / Inno Setup / WiX Toolset (Windows)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Principles

* Protocol-agnostic design (modular transport/codec stack)
* End-to-end security (from browser to agent)
* Modular component separation (UI, transport, agent logic)
* Performance-first rendering (GPU acceleration, adaptive FPS)
* Developer-friendly: open protocol spec, logs, metrics, and debugging tools
